## GoodBudget Tools

This project is designed to provide some additional tools for use with the
GoodBudget budgetting web application.

It is important to note that these tools are entirely experimental. They have 
not been created by GoodBudget nor have they been created with any authority
of GoodBudget.

GoodBudget is not my application and while all care has been taken to ensure
that these tools do not disrupt or degrade your data with GoodBudget I cannot
make any guarantees.
